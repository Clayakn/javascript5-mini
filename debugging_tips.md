* Put a .catch on axios calls (or any promise)
* Read the error message 
* console.log
* Spell check
    * don't leave it to spelling errors if possible. E.g. redux action types, use a CONSTANT.
* look at syntax 
* Look back on old code/projects
* Google the error message 
* ask a neighbor 
* try breaking it harder
    *make sure it's actually breaking where you think it is
* get in the queue 
* ask online (stack overflow, etc)

general tips 
* add debug extensions 
    * bracket pair colorizer in VS code 
    * redux devtools 
    * react devtools
